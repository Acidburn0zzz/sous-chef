## Instructions for internationalization

### Updating .po files for every pull request, if applicable
**READ this section if you're here because of a failing Travis CI check.**

If commits in your pull request have introduced new translatable content, you must update the .po files and include them in your pull request.

1. `docker ps` to obtain the container ID for 'web'
2. `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`
3. `cd src`
4. `python3 manage.py makemessages -l fr -l en` to update the various django.po
files with your new strings.
5. Commit the changes to your branch to be included in the pull request.

### How the project gets translated
We use Transifex to translate the sous-chef project. In a nutshell, Transifex regularly obtains the translation (.po) files from this Django project, and translators can contribute on the [Transifex website](https://www.transifex.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef). Once in a while, a project member can run `tx pull` in the Docker container's root directory to pull (and then commit) the new translations.

### Enabling translations for a new Django application.
1. In your application create a folder `locale`
2. In `settings.py` add the locale path in `LOCALE_PATHS`,
  for example
```
    LOCALE_PATHS = (
    'meal/locale/',
    'member/locale/',
    'notification/locale/',
    'order/locale/',
    'page/locale/',
    )
```
