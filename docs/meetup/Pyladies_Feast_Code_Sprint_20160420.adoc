Most of the useful resources are hosted on https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef[GitHub].

* https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/blob/dev/INSTALL.md[Installation instructions]
* UI/UX screenshots
* https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/[Coding style guide]
* https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/issues[Issues]

## How to contribute

Contributions to an open-source project can take multiple forms:

* Code
* Documentation
* Tests and bug reporting
* Translations
* UX/UI experience

### Code

A pre-requisite is to have Feast installed on your machine. The installation procedure is based on Docker and is described https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/blob/dev/INSTALL.md[on GitHub].

#### Issues

Numerous issues are created and waiting for your love on the https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/issues[issue board].

IMPORTANT: The milestone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/milestones/Meetup%20PyLadies[Meetup PyLadies] has been created for the occasion. It regroups most of the issues that could be tackled during the meeting.

You may also use https://waffle.io/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef[Waffle] as a more *Agile-like* dashboard.

##### Issue trackers

Issues are categorized with the following labels:

* feature
* bug
* i18n (internationalization)
* docs (documentation)
* ux/ui
* tests

##### Issue categories

Besides than those tracker, issues are identified regarding the field of expertise:

* python
* frontend
* database

CAUTION: FOW is now using http://semantic-ui.com/[Semantic UI] as a frontend framework, replacing Bootstrap.

#### Workflow

* Fork the repository and work from there
* Commit and push your changes into your fork
* When you are done, create a https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/compare[Pull Request] in Feast repository

[IMPORTANT]
====
For your PR to be merged, it should respect the following:

    * Tests must pass
    * PEP-8 coding style must be respected
    * Code coverage must be complete
    * The branch can be merged automatically
====

https://travis-ci.org/[TravisCI] is configured to run those checks on every Pull-Request. It is recommanded you configure your fork to do the same.

### Documentation

Documentation is important and can always be improved:

* Installation instructions
* Test procedures
* How to help translating the project
* Updating the https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/wiki/TODO[Roadmap]

The prefered syntax is {doc-asciidoctor}[Asciidoc]. Markdown is also accepted.

The https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/wiki/[project wiki] on GitHub could also be used.


### Tests and bug reporting

It could be manual testing and reporting. The GitHub issues can be used for this.

It could also be functional and unit tests implementation. Each Django module has a *tests.py* file.

### Translations

FOW is a bilingual application and needs your talent of translators !

FOW uses Django multilingual framework, based on Gettext and po files.

Each module has its own set of translation files. To list them all:

 $ find . -name "*.po"

https://poedit.net/[Poedit] can be used to translate those files.
Follow the workflow described in the Code section to contribute your translations.

NOTE: An alternative way to contribute could be to send the po files through emails.

An other way to contribute there is to review the code and make sure all strings are translatable.

### UX/UI experience

This is a pretty vast domain, but, here it is:

* UX proposition
* Color schemes
* Logo
* Style guide
* Project name
